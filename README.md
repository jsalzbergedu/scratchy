# Scratchy - Extremely simple graphics

Scratchy is intended to be an extremely simple graphics platform for learning or rapid development. Inspired by scratch, it intends to combine the extremely simple and powerful media features of scratch with the expressive power of a real programming language.

# Starting Scratchy

To start scratchy, open the executable in a terminal and type (init [width] [height] [title]), e.g. (init 500 500 "Title").

# Using Scratchy

As of now, there is not much you can do with scratchy other than (init w h t) and (exit). In the future, scratchyi will serve as scratchy's interactive shell.
